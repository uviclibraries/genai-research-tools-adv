# Generative AI for Research: Qualitative Coding

<img src="images/images/1-qualitative-coding.jpeg" style="float:right;width:350px;padding:10px;" alt="Sentiment Analysis Visualization">

NotebookLM can be a real time saver when used for qualitative coding. It is an AI tool that can generate various insights relevant to qualitative research, such as summaries, trends in data, and synthesis of different sources. You can upload sources such as text, PDFs, websites, YouTube videos, audio files, .txt files, Google Docs or Google Slides. Please note that Word documents will need to be converted into a .txt file or Google Doc, or pasted as text.

## Capabilities & Considerations of NotebookLM:
NotebookLM can be a real time saver when used for thematic analysis. It is an AI tool that can generate various insights relevant to qualitative research, such as summaries, trends in data, and synthesis of different sources. You can upload sources such as text, PDFs, websites, YouTube videos, audio files, .txt files, Google Docs or Google Slides. Please note that Word documents will need to be converted into a .txt file or Google Doc, or pasted as text.

### Pros of using NotebookLM for thematic analysis:
Using NotebookLM can save you time, enhancing the efficiency of qualitative data analysis. Here are some key advantages of using this tool:
Data Organization and Synthesis: NotebookLM excels at synthesizing information from multiple documents. It allows users to create notebooks for specific projects and import relevant documents, enabling quick access to organized data.

**Custom Dataset Definition:** Unlike traditional AI tools that scrape the internet for information, NotebookLM allows users to define their own datasets. This means researchers can input their own notes, articles, and other qualitative data, ensuring that the AI works with reliable and relevant sources.

**Efficient Information Retrieval:** The tool can act as a virtual research assistant, capable of answering questions and tracking down references in the text based on the sources provided. This feature can save researchers significant time when searching for specific information within their qualitative data.

**Enhanced Analysis Capabilities:** NotebookLM can analyze text and identify themes, patterns, and insights within qualitative data. This capability can help researchers uncover implicit meanings and connections.

### Cons of using NotebookLM for thematic analysis:
It is important to note that insights generated by NotebookLM and other generative AI tools are not final products, but starting points for analysis. Outputs must be reviewed for accuracy and the following drawbacks must be taken into consideration:

**Limited Understanding of Nuance:** Although NotebookLM can analyze text and identify themes, it may struggle with the nuanced understanding of complex human emotions and motivations that qualitative research often requires. AI tools, including NotebookLM, may not fully capture the subtleties of human experience, which can lead to oversimplified interpretations of qualitative data.

**Dependence on Input Quality:** The effectiveness of NotebookLM is heavily reliant on the quality and relevance of the data inputted by the user.

**Potential for Bias:** Like many AI tools, NotebookLM can inadvertently reflect biases present in the training data or the input data provided by users. This can result in skewed analyses or interpretations that do not accurately represent the diversity of perspectives within qualitative research.

**Lack of Human Insight:** While NotebookLM can generate analyses and summaries, it lacks the human touch that is often crucial in qualitative research. Researchers bring their own insights, experiences, and contextual understanding to their work, which an AI tool cannot replicate.

**Privacy Limitations:** Unlike other AI tools, NotebookLM does not use your data for training purposes. However, your anonymized data will still go through external servers - this will need to be disclosed in your research ethics application and to research participants prior to beginning your research. To our knowledge, free AI tools that run on your local computer, such as GPT4All, are not as effective for analyzing qualitative data.

### Common uses for NotebookLM that are relevant for qualitative research
**Summarization**: An LLM can help you summarize many types of texts: reports, customer surveys, meeting notes, emails, and more.

**Classification**: Text classification is another common application for LLMs.

## Learning Objectives
- Import transcripts onto NotebookLM
- Identify key ideas/themes from transcripts
- Use NotebookLM to synthesize different transcripts
- Save insights generated from NotebookLM

## Thematic Analysis with NotebookLM
In this activity, you will use NotebookLM to identify and synthesize key themes/ideas from interviews with artists.

1. Go to [https://notebooklm.google/](https://notebooklm.google/){:target="_blank"} and click **Create new**. Once you’ve created a project, it will be saved on your home page.

2. To add a source, select “Website” under Link and paste the following link: ```https://www.sadmag.ca/blog/2024/8/28/sell-out-a-series-5-questions-with-ziggy-mimloid```
<img src="images/5-NotebookLM2.png" style="width:800px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;"><br>
3. You can now explore some of the suggested questions or features in the Notebook Guide generated by clicking on them. You can find more information about these features in the NotebookLM Learning Activity. You can click **Notebook guide** in the bottom right at any point to pull it up again.

5. To view your notes, close the chat by clicking the X mark on the top right or **Close Chat** on the bottom left. To re-open the chat, click **View Chat** on the bottom left. NotebookLM’s responses contain references to quotes. If you click the numbers at the end of sentences, you will see the original quotes on the left panel. Highlighting passages of text in this left panel will generate prompts at the bottom of the chat panel, including creating a new note with the passage or a summary of the passage. You can find related ideas in the text using the **Suggest related ideas** button, or an explanation of the highlighted passage using the **Help me understand** button.

<img src="images/5-NotebookLM6.png" style="width:200px;padding:10px;border: 1px solid #555;float:right;"><br>
6. To synthesize two interview transcripts, close the right panel if it is open and click the plus symbol beside **Sources** in the top left. Then, enter the following link: ```https://www.sadmag.ca/blog/2024/8/28/sell-out-a-series-5-questions-with-anne-sueyeun-seol```
7. Both sources will be automatically selected by default. You can select which sources you want to analyze by using the check marks.

9. In the text box, enter prompts to find commonalities between the two articles, such as _Synthesize the two interviews_ or _Identify common themes from both interviews._ Prompts can also depend on the insights you are looking for; a more specific example could be _Identify common approaches to balancing livelihoods and creativity among both artists interviewed_.
10. To re-name your project from the automatic title generated from the first source, click the title at the top. All chat responses and notes will then be saved under this title when you navigate to the home page. To share results, click the **Share** button on the top right.
