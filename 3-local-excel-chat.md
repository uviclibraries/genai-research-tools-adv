# Local and Private AI Chat with your Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets

Microsoft Excel allows you to create, manage, and analyze data in spreadsheet format. By attaching your spreadsheets directly to GPT4All, you can privately chat with the AI to query and explore the data, enabling you to summarize, generate reports, and glean insights from your filesâ€”all within your conversation.

6. How did it do? Do the summarized reports and insights sound reasonable? Or not?

## Limitations

It is important to double-check the claims LLMs make about the spreadsheets you provide. LLMs can make mistakes about the data they are presented, particularly for the LLMs with smaller parameter counts (~8B) that fit within the memory of consumer hardware.
